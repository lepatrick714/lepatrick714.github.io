        <h3>Debatings</h3>
        <p>
          I love debates! One of my favorite things in life is to answer the
          deeper questions in society. I'm interested in the macro economics of
          society and how we as individuals can make change for the betterment
          of humanity.

        <h3>Giving Back</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a proud believer of giving. One of my biggest goal in life was to
          be financially independent to conformably give back to humanity. There
          is a ton of suffering in the world and being a Citizen of Humanity, I
          have the privilege to relieve some of the suffering via monetary
          donations. Just a short ramballing for now, but I'll link a detailed
          blog about this and where I donate to in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          For now, here are a couple of resources to convince you to give back
          to humanity.

        <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <p>
          You think I enjoy sitting in front of a computer for hours at a time?
          No no no. I much rather go hiking, swimming, EATTING far away from
          home. I'll input some blogs/pictures of my travels soon!
